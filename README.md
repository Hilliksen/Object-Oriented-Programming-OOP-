THOUGHTS
All in all I think the PHP and backend in general is not my strongest suit but just like mathematics I find it a lot of fun if I understand whats going on, why is it working and how is it doing. Overall I think the exercises are going great and I feel like theres a lot of progress going on so i just need to keep my head down focus and annoy trainers with lots of questions about the details.

# OOP EXERCISES WITH ELAN FORMATION

Welcome whoever is viewing my profile! The purpose of these exercises (and this repository as a whole) is a project for training done by Elan Formation to be on par with a person with BAC+2 (meaning the higher national diploma or in second year of university) in programming. Thus the aim here is to learn and understand the OOP with the help of tutors or trainers that im working with in Elan Formation. If you would like to keep up with my progress and or just checking up on my skills remember that for every commit I will right a lengthy message explain what I did, so remember to hover over it or just click 3 little dots. Hope you have a great day!

### THOUGHTS
In all honesty I believe that the backend is not my strongest fort but it's bringing me a lot of joy and it allows me to develop not only my logical skills but also improve my attention to detail. I'm making good progress that I feel is very transparent in the way I think and they way I code, as it (OOP) is very important skill that is needed to have if I want to call myself a developer. All in all great language improving my skills.

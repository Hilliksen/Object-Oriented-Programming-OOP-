## What is an Object? :
- Think of a car with different colors wheels spoilers etc, those are what we call attributes (variables) and we have function that a car can do so start() drive() etc, and that is a method(function), all of those things come together to be make an object. BUT remember the car is not an Object, the collection of  attributes and methods is the object. 

## What are advantages of OOP?:
- The data and methods for that date are grouped together
- Reduced complexity and thus the confusion 
- Reusability 
- Makes its easire to make changes since they happen in one place and not in million different files and by extention you will have organized code which isnt messy 
- Easy to visualize the design
